Watch your back, watch your back
Watch your back, watch your back
We can counter their attack hit 'em 'til the armor cracks

This could get a little sticky
How to win this battle could be tricky but I know the best way
Fall back let me lead, you hold the line
And we'll bring them to their knees
Swords in the air if you're with me
They got us outnumbered one to fifty
But victory is ours 'cause I got a strategy, you take the left
And the rest of you can follow me (Un-uh)
This is my crew
